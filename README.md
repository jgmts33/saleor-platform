# saleor-platform
All Saleor services started from a single repository

## Requirements
1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


## How to run it?

1. Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:mirumee/saleor-platform.git
```

2. We are using shared folders to enable live code reloading. Without this, Docker Compose will not start:
    - Windows/MacOS: Add the cloned `saleor-platform` directory to Docker shared directories (Preferences -> Resources -> File sharing).
    - Linux: Already enabled

3. Go to the cloned directory:
```
$ cd saleor-platform
```

4. Fetch the submodules:
```
$ git submodule update --init --jobs 3
```

5. Build the application:
```
$ docker-compose build
```

6. Apply Django migrations:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm web python3 manage.py migrate
```

7. Collect static files:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm web python3 manage.py collectstatic
```

8. Populate the database with example data and create the admin user:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm web python3 manage.py populatedb --createsuperuser
```

9. Run the application:
```
$ docker-compose up
```


## How to update the subprojects to the newest versions?
By default, each of the subprojects is bound to a particular commit.
To update all of them to their newest master versions, run:
```
$ git submodule update --remote
```
